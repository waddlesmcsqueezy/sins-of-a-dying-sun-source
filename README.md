# Sins of a Dying Sun
This is the source repository for my videogame I am actively working on, Sins of a Dying sun. The logic for the game is written entirely in C# using Unity's Mono library.
## Description
A cosmic oceanic experience.
I aim for this to a be story driven game revolving around the player exploring the Moonlight Sea as they uncover the mysteries of why the Sun is dimmed.
